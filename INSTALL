GNOME Disks is built through Meson.
How to obtain and use it is documented here:
http://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html

configure the build directory:
  meson builddir

(skip if not needed:
configure the build directory with options:
  meson -D libsystemd=true|false -D gsd_plugin=true|false builddir

list the available options and their current values:
  meson configure builddir

reconfigure a value:
  meson configure builddir -D libsystemd=true|false -D gsd_plugin=true|false
)

compile:
  cd builddir
  ninja

run GNOME Disks:
  builddir/src/disks/gnome-disks

produce a release tarball:
  cd builddir
  ninja dist

This will build against the system libraries.
JHBuild can build against recent library versions:
