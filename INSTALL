GNOME Disks is built through Meson.
How to obtain and use it is documented here:
http://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html

configure the build directory:
  meson builddir

compile:
  cd builddir
  ninja

run GNOME Disks:
  builddir/src/disks/gnome-disks

produce a release tarball:
  ninja dist

This will build against the system libraries.
