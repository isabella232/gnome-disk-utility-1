gnome-disk-utility (3.0.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/watch: Update for new upstream URL.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Merge changes from unstable branch.
  * Refresh debian/patches/00git-palimpsest-small-screens.patch.
  * Avoid partial upgrades involving gnome-disk-utility and libgdu-gtk.
    Bump the symbol versions in libgdu-gtk0.symbols to 3.0.0 and add
    Breaks: gnome-disk-utility (<< 3.0.0) to libgdu-gtk0 as a workaround for
    libgdu-gtk building against GTK3 (which changes its ABI) but not bumping
    the soname. (Closes: #626821)

gnome-disk-utility (2.32.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Lots of translation updates.
    - Use accessor functions instead direct access, for GTK 3 compliance.
    - Nuke gtk-doc usage for now. It was never really set up correctly and
      it's causing issues with autotools and dist checking.
    - Note that we keep 00git-palimpsest-small-screens.patch. It was reverted
      upstream for now, since it is not a perfect solution; but it does
      improve matters on small screens.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Use dpkg-vendor instead of lsb_release.
  * Stop installing gtk-doc API documentation. It has  been removed upstream.
    - Update debian/libgdu-dev.install.
    - Drop Conflicts/Replaces from libgdu-dev as it no longer necessary.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 8. Update Build-Depends accordingly.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.2. No further changes.
  * Switch from cdbs to dh
    - Drop Build-Depends on cdbs.
    - Convert debian/rules to use dh.
    - Override dh_auto_test to disable test suite.
    - Add debian/gnome-disk-utility.docs.

gnome-disk-utility (2.30.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 00git-palimpsest-small-screens.patch: Add scrollbars to the right pane
    if the window is smaller than the contents. This makes palimpsest working
    on small screens. (Closes: #589502, LP: #414107, GNOME #594088)
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1 (no changes necessary).
  * Convert source package to "3.0 (quilt)" format.

gnome-disk-utility (2.29.90-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/libgdu-gtk0.symbols
    - Bump symbol versions to 2.29.90 for all symbols that were added after
      version 2.28.1.
  * debian/control
    - Bump Build-Depends on libglib2.0-dev to (>= 2.22).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Move gtk-doc files (which describe the API, not the palimpsest program)
    from gnome-disk-utility to libgdu-dev. Add an appropriate
    Conflicts/Replaces. (LP: #517698)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Thu, 04 Mar 2010 16:23:53 +0100

gnome-disk-utility (2.29.90-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

gnome-disk-utility (2.29.0~git20100222.e85476-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Git snapshot of the upcoming 2.29.0 release:
    - Port to udisks.
    - Grid based UI for palimpsest.
    - Initial support for LVM2.
  * Remove patches
    - debian/patches/01-reiserfs-support.patch (merged upstream)
    - debian/patches/02-link-against-libx11-for-xkb.patch (merged upstream)
    - debian/patches/99-autoreconf.patch (no longer required)
  * debian/control
    - Update package descriptions for the DeviceKit-disks → udisks renaming.
    - Add Build-Depends on libavahi-ui-dev (>= 0.6.25), and replace
      devicekit-disks (>= 007) Build-Depends with udisks (>= 1.0.0~).
    - Replace Depends on devicekit-disks (>= 007) with
      udisks (>= 1.0.0~), udisks (<< 1.1.0).
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4. No further changes.
  * debian/*.symbols
    - Update symbols files for libgdu0 and libgdu-gtk0.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add 01_delay_autostart.patch: Delay autostart of the gdu daemon for 10
    seconds. It is not needed immediately (thus no need to slow down initial
    session startup) and is not visible permanently (thus it won't cause
    visual disruptions later on). This depends on the patch in GNOME #608402,
    and will be a no-op if that's not available.
  * debian/control: Move udisks dependency from g-d-u to libgdu0, since it's
    really the library which talks to it. Otherwise you could not install
    g-d-u and get crashes in GNOME. (LP: #523634)

gnome-disk-utility (2.28.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control
    - Move devicekit-disks dependency from g-d-u to libgdu0, since it's really
      the library which talks to it.
      Also, other packages using libgdu0, like gvfs, should not have to add an
      explicit dependency on devicekit-disks as it's libgdu0's responsibility
      to depend on the correct backend.

gnome-disk-utility (2.28.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/01-reiserfs-support.patch
    - Add support for ReiserFS.
  * debian/patches/02-link-against-libx11-for-xkb.patch
    - Explicitly link against libX11 as g-d-u uses Xkb* functions and it
      otherwise fails to build with binutils-gold. (Closes: #554650)
  * debian/patches/99-autoreconf.patch
    - Run autoreconf for the changes in 02-link-against-libx11-for-xkb.patch.

    - Follow GNOME release cycle now.
    - Lots of bug fixes and translation updates.
    - Land new ATA SMART user interface (requires DK-disks 007).
  * debian/control:
    - Drop old libpolkit*-dev build and binary dependencies.
    - Bump devicekit-disks build/binary dependency to >= 007.
    - Bump libgtk2.0-dev and libatasmart-dev build dependencies as required by
      upstream.
    - Drop libsexy-dev build dependency, not necessary any more.
  * debian/control: Add alternative build dependency "rarian-compat", the
    successor of scrollkeeper.
  * debian/libgdu0.symbols, debian/libgdu-gtk0.symbols: Update for new
    release.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes necessary).
  * debian/rules: When building for Ubuntu, update palimpsest .desktop's
    Category field to appear in System → Administration instead of Apps →
    System Tools.
  * debian/*.install: Drop debian/tmp/ prefix, since we use dh compat 7.
    Also, simplify and sort the file lists.
  * debian/control: Added myself to uploaders, with Michael's consent.
