  [ Martin Pitt ]

    - Follow GNOME release cycle now.
    - Lots of bug fixes and translation updates.
    - Land new ATA SMART user interface (requires DK-disks 007).
  * debian/control:
    - Drop old libpolkit*-dev build and binary dependencies.
    - Bump devicekit-disks build/binary dependency to >= 007.
    - Bump libgtk2.0-dev and libatasmart-dev build dependencies as required by
      upstream.
    - Drop libsexy-dev build dependency, not necessary any more.
  * debian/control: Add alternative build dependency "rarian-compat", the
    successor of scrollkeeper.
  * debian/libgdu0.symbols, debian/libgdu-gtk0.symbols: Update for new
    release.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes necessary).
