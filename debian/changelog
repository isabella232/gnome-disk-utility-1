gnome-disk-utility (2.29.0~git20100222.e85476-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Git snapshot of the upcoming 2.29.0 release:
    - Port to udisks.
    - Grid based UI for palimpsest.
    - Initial support for LVM2.
  * Remove patches
    - debian/patches/01-reiserfs-support.patch (merged upstream)
    - debian/patches/02-link-against-libx11-for-xkb.patch (merged upstream)
    - debian/patches/99-autoreconf.patch (no longer required)
  * debian/control
    - Update package descriptions for the DeviceKit-disks → udisks renaming.
    - Add Build-Depends on libavahi-ui-dev (>= 0.6.25), and replace
      devicekit-disks (>= 007) Build-Depends with udisks (>= 1.0.0~).
    - Replace Depends on devicekit-disks (>= 007) with
      udisks (>= 1.0.0~), udisks (<< 1.1.0).
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4. No further changes.
  * debian/*.symbols
    - Update symbols files for libgdu0 and libgdu-gtk0.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add 01_delay_autostart.patch: Delay autostart of the gdu daemon for 10
    seconds. It is not needed immediately (thus no need to slow down initial
    session startup) and is not visible permanently (thus it won't cause
    visual disruptions later on). This depends on the patch in GNOME #608402,
    and will be a no-op if that's not available.
  * debian/control: Move udisks dependency from g-d-u to libgdu0, since it's
    really the library which talks to it. Otherwise you could not install
    g-d-u and get crashes in GNOME. (LP: #523634)

gnome-disk-utility (2.28.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control
    - Move devicekit-disks dependency from g-d-u to libgdu0, since it's really
      the library which talks to it.
      Also, other packages using libgdu0, like gvfs, should not have to add an
      explicit dependency on devicekit-disks as it's libgdu0's responsibility
      to depend on the correct backend.

gnome-disk-utility (2.28.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/01-reiserfs-support.patch
    - Add support for ReiserFS.
  * debian/patches/02-link-against-libx11-for-xkb.patch
    - Explicitly link against libX11 as g-d-u uses Xkb* functions and it
      otherwise fails to build with binutils-gold. (Closes: #554650)
  * debian/patches/99-autoreconf.patch
    - Run autoreconf for the changes in 02-link-against-libx11-for-xkb.patch.

    - Follow GNOME release cycle now.

    - Bump libgtk2.0-dev and libatasmart-dev build dependencies as required by
      upstream.
    - Drop libsexy-dev build dependency, not necessary any more.
  * debian/control: Add alternative build dependency "rarian-compat", the
    successor of scrollkeeper.
  * debian/libgdu0.symbols, debian/libgdu-gtk0.symbols: Update for new
    release.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes necessary).
  * debian/rules: When building for Ubuntu, update palimpsest .desktop's
    Category field to appear in System → Administration instead of Apps →
    System Tools.
  * debian/*.install: Drop debian/tmp/ prefix, since we use dh compat 7.
    Also, simplify and sort the file lists.
  * debian/control: Added myself to uploaders, with Michael's consent.
